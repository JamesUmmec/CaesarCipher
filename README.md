This project is not finished yet...

---

Caesar Cipher is an ancient cipher tool which shift letters, such as `a` represent `b` and `b` represent `c`. Although this cipher is very easy, it is still interesting.

This repo is not expected be a useful tool, it is just a toy to practice `golang` and `vue/vite` framework. This project combine Caesar Cipher and digital bytes which saves data in files. You can encrypt any file with this tool using password in any string consist of characters of `unicode`.

Enjoy!
